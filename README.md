# Spar Engine
A simple rendering engine built to showcase various DX11 techniques.

# Build and run
### Deps:
   1. xmake
   2. Visual Studio (works on other IDEs as well, but its preferable. Read more here if interested: https://xmake.io/mirror/plugin/builtin_plugins.html)

```
xmake project -k vsxmake
xmake run 
```
(yup this simple :D)
